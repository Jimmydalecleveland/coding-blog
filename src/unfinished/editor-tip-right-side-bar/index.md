in vscode (and other editors allowing it) place sidebar to the right instead of default left because it doesn't shift your text over when you open and close it. If you are like me, and sometimes you close your sidebar for the extra realestate to split panes, this just makes sense when thinking about other UIs. Typically some overlay that's optional should lay on top of the existing space, rather than move everything over. It isn't a huge deal, just a minor convenience when you adjust to it.
