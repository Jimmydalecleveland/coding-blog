`ssh root@167.99.999.9`

in root `~` create a new directory for your site, cd into it, install express locally and create the hello world for express in the docs (touch app.js, vim into it). swap port 3000 for port 80 when following instructions. 

once the file is setup, run `node app.js`

once express is running (use port 80 as it is the default http port that is open on droplets initially)
